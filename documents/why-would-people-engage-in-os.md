After reading [Processing and FLOSS](https://medium.com/processing-foundation/processing-and-floss-d35aa4607f4c), I felt refreshed about what I have learned. Especially the point that the article mentioned about the Multipossibility of combined softwares [\[1\]](https://medium.com/processing-foundation/processing-and-floss-d35aa4607f4c#90cd).

> FLOSS software is an ecology where thousands of projects, large and small, can be combined in different ways to create new software.

As I demostrated in my last reflection, I regard Open Source as *Idea Sharing*, which integrates different points of view on one tools or one project. But I cannot agree more that I miss up another essential significance of Open Source Project - the reuse of ideas and works. Besides the example that *Processing* takes advantages of *JNA*, *Apache Ant*, or *JUnit*. Many famous open source projects stand on multiple of other extraordinary, reusing their brilliant ideas and make them shinier.

Our great Open Source Community Github has a tab about the relation between projects (it might only available on some projects that use package management tools like *Maven*, *npm*, *yarn*, etc.) Inside one project, we can find a tab **Insights**, then go to **Dependency Graph** on the left. A fully detailed dependency graph is shown about the open source projects this project reuses and the other that base on this project. For example, the dependency of [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/network/dependencies).

And this is exactly the idea that owns *freedoms to modify and expand* anything[\[2\]](https://medium.com/processing-foundation/processing-and-floss-d35aa4607f4c#09d4). There is no best software and tool, but only the tool that fits one most. Open Source can realise people's dream on that.

Another great example is **VIM**, a controversial Text Editor. Many people addict to it is not for the design or difficulty for using (actually I find it really hard to manage in some ways), but for the self-manipulation and customization. As if one can write more efficient code with self-configured **vim** than any other IDE or Text Editor like **Jet Brains**, **VS Code**, **Atom**, etc. But others become a fool when they use this totally customized toy!

So for community, one can add any possibility to a great project and polish it. On the other hand, for self, any great Open Source Project can be a powerful arm to simplify its life.
